# Social Media API

## Description

An API for a hypothetical social media platform using a NoSQL database to handle large amounts of user data. This project allowed me to learn much more about Mongoose and NoSQL databases!

## Installation

Download the files onto your computer. Using node or npm install all dependencies with the command ```node install``` or ```npm i ```.

## Usage

In your local environment run the command ```npm start``` to boot up the server on your device. Then, with the server live and listening, you can use either your browser or an API platform (such as Postman or Insomnia) to send requests to the server directly! This API allows you to create, update, read and delete data associated with individual users, their "thoughts", "reactions" and their associated friends!
